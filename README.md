# What's  A Dollar Cost?
## Exploring the Price of Incarceration within the United States Prison System

While the December 18, 1865 proclamation of the Thirteenth Amendment protected most United States (US) residents from enslavement, it failed to defend people convicted of crimes.  Today, more than 150 years later, incarcerated people across US prisons are still being subjected to slavery.  According to a June 2022 report made by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), roughly 800,000 incarcerated people are subjected to working conditions characterized by imbalanced power dynamics and  inadequately compensated labor.

So, whatâ€™s a dollar cost to these folks?  While this value varies across types of detention centers throughout different states, one thing is consistent: the dollar of an incarcerated person is far harder earned than the dollar of someone not subjected to the US prison system.
